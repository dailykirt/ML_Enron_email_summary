However, as the business community appears to be trying to get back to normal as far as possible, we have decided that the conference should proceed as planned. We therefore hope you will take this excellent opportunity to hear the industry response to the latest Basel proposals on Capital Adequacy and Risk Management, and to gain practical advice on meeting the significant business challenges that these proposals pose to the management of risk within the financial services industry. Conference highlights include: A keynote address from William Rutledge, Executive Vice President, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK An impressive panel of leading industry speakers visit the event website http://www.ibcfinancial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2 for full programme details.
