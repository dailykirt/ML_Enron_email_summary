       "\"Dear Mr Skilling, http://www.ibcfinancial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2 Update on IBC's major international conference: BASEL MEETING THE PRACTICAL CHALLENGES 31st October and 1st November 2001 New York We have obviously considered very carefully whether to continue with this event in the light of the recent terrible events in New York. However, as the business community appears to be trying to get back to normal as far as possible, we have decided that the conference should proceed as planned. We therefore hope you will take this excellent opportunity to hear the industry response to the latest Basel proposals on Capital Adequacy and Risk Management, and to gain practical advice on meeting the significant business challenges that these proposals pose to the management of risk within the financial services industry. Conference highlights include: A keynote address from William Rutledge, Executive Vice President, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF NEW YORK An impressive panel of leading industry speakers visit the event website http://www.ibcfinancial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2 for full programme details. Round table discussion: examining the key elements of operational risk management and control Outstanding networking opportunity over 100 delegates attended our European Capital Adequacy event earlier this year To reserve your place call +44 (0)1932 853 857, visit http://www.ibcfinancial.com/bm1272/?source=bm1272em2, or email cust.serv@informa.com. Alternatively, please forward this email to any colleagues from ENRON CAPITAL & TRADE RESOURCES CORP who may also be interested in attending. Kind regards Allison Lindsay Deputy Conference Director This email is sponsored by Back Office Focus a specialist monthly magazine that answers your critical needs for understanding technology in and out of the office environment, and how to apply these developments to your benefit and company profitability. http://www.informafinance.com/bof/?source=ibcfec If you do not wish to receive information and news on this subject in future please reply to this email with the message UNSUBSCRIBE in the subject line and you will be instantly removed from this list.
