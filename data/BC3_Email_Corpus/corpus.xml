        <Sent id="1.1">The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating logistics and planning problems. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">I suggest that future meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user services issues the first week, and all other issues the second week. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and other people could attend only one week. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">Those who choose to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and do better liaisons between the different areas. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">The Friday of the first week could discuss applications issues which might be of special interest to the other areas, and the Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which might be of special interest to applications people, so some people could attend Monday-Monday or Friday-Friday.

</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.2">My problem over the past year or so is that there are only a few session I wish to attend, but I cannot know for sure when they will be scheduled, so I cannot make reasonable travel arrangements (a week in Orlando for 6 hours of meetings is hard to sell to management). </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3">Now I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged to participate broadly. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">And I am hopeful that new activities (my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to attend. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">But firmer scheduling would be a big win.

        <Sent id="3.2">WG Chairs already are asked to specify which clashes they want to avoid, but clash avoidance is an iterative problem. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.3">I just don't see how late changes can be completely avoided. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.4">Obviously, everybody knows they need to be minimised.

        <Sent id="3.6">No way. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.7">Taking one week out of our calendars 3 times a year is already very painful, and a lot of people really do need and want to track multiple areas of the IETF. </Sent>

        <Sent id="4.1">Working groups don't seem to decide at the last minute whether or not they need a meeting, or what their conflict avoidance criteria needs to be. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">This leads me to believe that we could create the IETF schedule earlier without causing significant pain. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">For example, it would be very useful so that the final WG schedule was available more than 21 days in advance, in order to get advanced purchase tickets. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">This would mean that the apps area schedule should be set tentatively 30-35 days in advance, so that the draft IETF schedule could be published and conflicts reviewed.

        <Sent id="1.1">hi all, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.2">As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-rdf-interest/2003Apr/0252.html 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">so we'll have to see how that pans out. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/Europe/200303/geo/intro.html#demos 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.9">So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.10">We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11">At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like:

</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.13">which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.14">and http://www.cadmium.co.uk/thumbs/ds/maps%20and%20globes/t_11407324.jpg.jpg 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.15">which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.16">Do people have a preference for one style over the other? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.17">Could you let us know today if possible? </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.18">We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.19">thanks,

        <Sent id="4.3">- it's a good piece of work. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">How about we have the following categories: </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.5">+ Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.6">+ Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7">+ Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.8">+ References </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.9">These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.10">For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.11">But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.12">A source editing tool can use this technique to any level. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">I agree. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">I'd really like to work on emphasizing cross-over situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">- Jan </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">&amp;gt; How about we have the following categories: </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">&amp;gt; + Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">&amp;gt; + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8">&amp;gt; + Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9">&amp;gt; + References </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.10">&amp;gt; These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.11">&amp;gt; For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.12">&amp;gt; But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.13">&amp;gt; A source editing tool can use this technique to any level. </Sent>

        <Sent id="2.3">My name is Daniel Dardailler and I work for W3C, acting as overall WAI Project Manager and also chair of the Evaluation&amp;amp;amp;Repair working group (Len is chairing the Interest Group). </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4">My involvement in Accessibility goes back to 1993 or so, when I started working on X Window Access. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.5">I started at W3C in 1996 and helped starting and launching the WAI in 1997. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.6">I think the work we're about to do in these two complementary ER groups is paramount to the success of the WAI. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">&gt; If we adopted a "use graphics" requirement as a P1, would a blind designer be able to meet that requirement effectively? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">These insure a sensible flow chart... </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">at least a chart that "parses" correctly. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">On the other hand, I've seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they're using.</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8">I'll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9">Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.10">Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.11">Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can't be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules? </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.12">Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines: </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.13">we're just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.14">Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.15">As for art by people born blind... I'm not familiar with that area but I woudn't be surprised there's some remarkable use of shape and form.

        <Sent id="5.1">Sailesh, 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">Make Accessible is a command that attempts to analyze an untagged PDF file and infer logical structure from the marks on the page. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">This would be used by an author who is trying to repair accessibility problems in an existing PDF file. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">The best analogy is that it is doing OCR on the logical strucure. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">Like OCR technology, it is imperfect, and the results should be reviewed and corrected, if necessary, by the author. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">In Acrobat 5, this command was only available on Windows. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7">In Acrobat 6, it is available for both Mac and Windows. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8">When the Adobe Reader 6.0 is presenting an untagged PDF file to assistive technology, it automatically runs MakeAccessible internally to infer logical structure. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9">This can make loading an untagged PDF considerably slower than loading a tagged PDF, but makes it possible, for example, to read tables even in an untagged PDF.

</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.2">MS-Word has elegant text-editing commands that are absent from a basic text editor, and that make editing documents a pleasure. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.3">For example, you can quickly move entire lines or paragraphs without using the clipboard; 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.4">select words, sentences, and paragraphs by pressing a single key; </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.5">and undo and redo 100 levels. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.6">All of the above can be done using keyboard and point-and-click techniques. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7">So there is a lot of versatility. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.8">Unfortunately, many of the really powerful Word commands are extremely poorly documented. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.9">Furthermore, savvy Word users can create special-purpose editing commands in Visual Basic to enhance the usefulness of the word processor as a text editor. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="4.10">Why use Word? </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.11">Because it is a good tool for the job.

        <Sent id="9.3">For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc. the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period. </Sent>
        <Sent id="9.4">The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the 
 responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible. </Sent>

        <Sent id="1.2">So far, about 24 screen reader users have sent in votes. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3">One person didn't like the screen reader version because of the long links. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.4">What he didn't realize was that the links were the same for both versions. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5">He just hadn't run into them in the standard version before trying the version for screen reader users. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6">Two other users forgot to make a choice. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7">The remaining 21 users preferred the version formatted for screen readers over the standard version. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.8">A couple of people commented that they would want some more text on the screen reader version. </Sent>

        <Sent id="5.1">&amp;gt; It is possible that you are on another mailing list that is sending you the www-font messages. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2">&amp;gt; If you're on an internal mailing list where you work, for instance, and someone subscribed that list to the www-font list, you may be getting it indirectly, in which case unsubscribing yourself will not get you off the list.</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3">Thanks for the helpful info, but I just received a message saying that I have been removed from the list. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4">Why? </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5">Because I posted my difficulties to the list. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6">Sorry I had to burden you all with my problems, but as you can see, it worked. </Sent>
