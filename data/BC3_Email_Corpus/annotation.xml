      <summary>
        <sent link="1.1">The e-mails contain discussions regarding a programming language, and specifically regarding a question that David initiated on whether or not if you create a page with alt tags and bring it into word to edit it and then export it back to html that the alts are stripped.</sent>
        <sent link="2.7,2.8,2.9,2.10,2.11">Chris guessed that he would expect that to happen if David can confirm the scenario that it starts with an HTML document, and contains an &lt;/ALT&gt;&lt;IMG&gt; with the ALT= attribute, the HTML doc is opened in Word and some text on the page is changed or added, and the page is "saved as HTML" from word, without first saving it in Word format.</sent>
        <sent link="3.1,3.2,3.3,3.4">Jamie also gave other explanations to David's questions as many people who are not web professionals required to edit and create web, and it is the only "WYSIWYG" tool available to them is Word.</sent>
        <sent link="4.11">In addressing the question as to why would people use Word to edit an HTML document, Alan replied that word is a good tool to do the job</sent>
        <sent link="6.3,6.4">However, Kynn suggested that Hot Metal Pro which is a web editor tool that does accessibility and valid HTML, also has the ability to import Word files which would save more time, rather than cutting and pasting and saving is as an HTML document.</sent>
        <sent link="8.11">Daniel also suggested to Chris that if he is interested in the kind of issue regarding html to word to html, then he should join the WAI Authoring Tools.</sent>

        <sent link="3.5">Kynn disagrees because blind people may not be able to describe an image as accurately as a sighted person.</sent>
        <sent link="5.2">Leonard also agrees that it depends on the individual, not the level of ability that determines how well one will do with graphics.</sent>

        <sent link="1.1">The discussions in the e-mails are about deciding the teleconference time that is best for everyone since they are all in different parts of the world with significant time differences between the countries. 
The concern was first due to one of the meeting attendee, Liddy, who had to wake up at 2am on a regular basis for the teleconference.</sent>
        <sent link="1.3">And thus, Jutta had suggested that they find an alternative time that works for everyone who are involved in the teleconference.</sent>
        <sent link="1.5">Jutta suggested a teleconference time at 4:00pm EDT on Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday.</sent>
        <sent link="3.6,4.3,5.2">However, due to the different schedule that everyone has, other meeting times would have been difficult to agree upon since it would conflict with other meeting schedule and thus it would be difficult to find a common time that works for every time zone in different countries.</sent>
